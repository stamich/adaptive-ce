# Changelog

## 0.3 — 2026-09-12

### Planner V3

- Added `ace-cost` and moved cheap candidate estimation out of runtime codec execution.
- Added `CandidateEstimator`, `EstimatedCandidate`, `CostModelV3` and profile-specific `SamplePolicy`.
- Replaced full-block candidate trial compression in the hot planner with deterministic Top-K sample verification.
- Added adaptive Top-K depth based on estimator confidence.
- Added deterministic planner fast paths for incompressible, run-heavy, strongly repetitive and strong-delta blocks.
- Added `PlannerTelemetry` fields for fast-path hits, estimated candidates, sampled candidates and full trial encodes.
- Runtime planner now targets zero full candidate trial encodes per block.

### Entropy / Format

- Added four-lane `rANS4x` entropy mode.
- Added `EntropyCodecId::Rans4x`.
- Bumped writer format from ACE 1.1 to ACE 1.2.
- Kept decoder compatibility with ACE 1.0 and 1.1.
- Added validation preventing the 1.2-only entropy ID from being accepted in older framing.

### SIMD and runtime

- Added `ace-simd` with safe scalar/AVX2 runtime dispatch.
- Analyzer zero counting can use AVX2.
- LZ longest-match prefix comparison can use AVX2.
- Added `WorkerScratch` reusable buffer boundary in `ace-runtime`.

### Streaming

- Added `ace-stream`.
- Added bounded-memory `compress_reader_known_size`.
- Added `StreamLimits` and `StreamingStats`.
- Streaming output retains the regular ACE index/trailer and therefore remains random-access capable.
- Added CLI `compress-stream` command.

### Benchmarks

- Benchmark schema upgraded for milestone 0.3 and Format 1.2.
- Added `rANS4x` entropy benchmark.
- Planner benchmark now records fast-path rate, estimates/block, samples/block and full-trial encodes/block.
- Random-access benchmark now separates `range_64k_cold` and `range_64k_warm`.
- Renamed reported physical read ratio to `physical_to_logical_ratio`.
- Added `streaming` and `memory` benchmark families.
- Regression baseline changed to the successful 0.2.1-buildfix1 release.

### Security / hardening

- Kept checked arithmetic around stream size, block count and index offsets.
- rANS4x validates metadata length, lane payload lengths and output lane reconstruction.
- Architecture-specific unsafe code is isolated inside `ace-simd`.
- Streaming validates exact declared source size and rejects truncated/overlong sources.

## 0.2.1-buildfix1

- Restored FAST profile throughput by fixing normalized cost weighting.
- Raised planner candidate recall to 100% on the reference corpus.
- Fixed random-access benchmark semantics and benchmark validator version hard-coding.
- Preserved ACE Format 1.2.

## 0.2.1

- Added CandidateTier, Cost Model V2.1, profile calibration, detailed benchmark observability and regression gates.

## 0.2

- Added scalar rANS, block index/random access, parallel blocks, dictionary abstractions and JSON benchmark contract.

## 0.1

- Initial adaptive block planner, RAW/RLE/LZ, Delta transform, Huffman, Format 1.0, CRC32C and CLI.
